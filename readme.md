Pmpmesh
===========================================================================

Pmpmesh is a mesh loader library forked from picomodel, migrated to c++ completely. It fixed many compiling errors.

This library is mainly used as one dependency of my other projects, I will never guarantee any stable api, the api might be changed very frequently, use it at your own risk.
